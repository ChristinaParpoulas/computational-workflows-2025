# Course Description
This practical course will give you a hands-on introduction to the innovative landscape of computational workflows in biomedical research, with a specialized focus on Nextflow and nf-core. This course is designed to equip participants with the essential tools and techniques required to effectively analyze complex biological data.

Key Topics Covered:
(1) Introduction to computational workflows with a focus on Nextflow and nf-core: Understanding the fundamentals
(2) Building scalable and reproducible workflows
(3) Data preprocessing and quality control in bioinformatics using workflows
(4) Concepts for the implementation of workflows to leverage cloud computing resources and other infrastructures

What you will Gain:

(1) Practical experience in designing and implementing computational workflows
(2) Proficiency in utilizing Nextflow and nf-core for bioinformatics analysis
(3) Skills in data preprocessing, quality control, and integration
(4) Ability to optimize workflows for scalability and reproducibility and specifically to reprocess publicly available data

Will have the chance to work independently or in teams on research projects, implementing and using computational workflows. You will present the results of your research and implementation project (about 20 minutes) and write a short scientific paper (approx. 2000 words).
Where: M3 research center, Otfried-MÃ¼ller-Str. 37, Seminar Room Level 2.

# Required Setup

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
````
# install and setup up on your machine:
conda
docker

# install via Conda:
nextflow>=25.04
nf-core>=3.3
